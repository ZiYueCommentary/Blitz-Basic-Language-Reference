# Basic Data Types

There are 3 basic data types:

* **Integer values** are numeric values with no fractional part in them. For example: `5`,`-10`,`0` are integer values. All integer values in your program must be in the range -2147483648 to +2147483647.
* **Floating point** values are numeric values that include a fractional part. For example: `.5`, `-10.1`, `0.0` are all floating point values.
* **Strings values** are used to contain text. For example: `"Hello"`, `"What's up?"`, `"***** GAME OVER *****"`, `""`.

Typically, integer values are faster than floating point values, which are themselves faster than strings.
