# Identifiers

Identifiers are used for constant names, variable names, array names, function names, and custom type names.

Identifiers must start with an alphabetic character, and may be following be any number of alphanumeric characters, or the underscore (`_`) character.

These are all valid identifiers:

* Hello
* Score
* player1
* time\_to\_live
* t\_\_

Identifiers are not case-sensitive.

For example, `Test`, `TEST` and `test` are all the same identifiers.

However, it is allowed for identifiers to be reused for functions and custom types names.

For example, you can have a variable called test, a function called `test` and a custom type name called `test`. Blitz will be able to tell which one you are referring to by the context in which it is used.
