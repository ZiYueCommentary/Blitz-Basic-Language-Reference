# Comments

You add comments to your programs using the `;` character. Everything following `;` until the end of the line will be ignored, this is useful for commenting on your code - so you can always look through and follow each line in a logical manner.

The following code shows comments in use:

```basic
; Begin the Redraw Function
Function Redraw()
    ...
End Function 
```

This code also shows another legal use of comments:

```basic
Function Redraw() ; Begin the Redraw Function
    ...
End Function 
```
